:fas:`code` Contribute
======================

If you're reading this section, you're probably interested in
contributing to SSH-MITM. Welcome and thanks for your interest in
contributing!

Please take a look at the documentation, familiarize yourself with using SSH-MITM,
and introduce yourself to the community and share what area of the project
you are interested in working on.

We have labeled some issues as `good first
issue <https://github.com/ssh-mitm/ssh-mitm/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22>`__
or `help
wanted <https://github.com/ssh-mitm/ssh-mitm/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22>`__
that we believe are good examples of small, self-contained changes. We
encourage those that are new to the code base to implement and/or ask
questions about these issues. You are not required to ask for a permission
to work on such issue, but if you do and do not get a reply within 48 hours
please assume that no one else is working on it (even if someone previously
volunteered) and open a pull request with proposed implementation.
If you are not certain about the implementation, using draft pull requests is encouraged.

If you believe you’ve found a security vulnerability in SSH-MITM,
please report it to support@ssh-mitm.at.

We are very pleased to have you as a contributor, and we hope you will find valuable your impact on the projects.
Thank you for sharing your interests, ideas, and skills with us.
