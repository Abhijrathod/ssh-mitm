OpenSSH
=======

OpenSSH (also known as OpenBSD Secure Shell[a]) is a suite of secure networking utilities
based on the Secure Shell (SSH) protocol, which provides a secure channel over an unsecured
network in a client–server architecture.

OpenSSH started as a fork of the free SSH program developed by Tatu Ylönen; later versions of
Ylönen's SSH were proprietary software offered by SSH Communications Security.
OpenSSH was first released in 1999 and is currently developed as part of the OpenBSD operating system.

OpenSSH is not a single computer program, but rather a suite of programs that serve as alternatives
to unencrypted protocols like Telnet and FTP. OpenSSH is integrated into several operating systems,
namely Microsoft Windows, macOS and most Linux operating systems, while the portable version is available
as a package in other systems.

   The vulnerabilities are divided into 3 categories. At the CVE numbers you can see an icon to identify the support by SSH-MITM.

   * :fas:`check;sd-text-success` Integrated in SSH-MITM - A test or exploit is integrated in SSH-MITM and relevant information is available in the documentation.
   * :fas:`info;sd-text-primary` extended information describing how the vulnerability works or vulnerabilities can be exploited without SSH-MITM
   * :fas:`link;sd-text-info` same entry as from official CVE databases
   * :fas:`question;sd-text-warning` disputed vulnerabilities - it's not clear if this is a security issue or not
   * :fas:`ban;sd-text-secondary` rejected CVE number - the CVE Number was rejected because of no security issues
