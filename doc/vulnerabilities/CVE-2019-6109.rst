    :bdg-warning:`CVSS 6.8` CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N
    ^^^
    An issue was discovered in OpenSSH 7.9. Due to missing character encoding in the progress
    display, a malicious server (or Man-in-The-Middle attacker) can employ crafted object
    names to manipulate the client output, e.g., by using ANSI control codes to hide
    additional files being transferred. This affects refresh_progress_meter() in progressmeter.c.
    +++
    **Affected Software:**

    * OpenSSH <= 7.9
    * WinSCP <= 5.13

    :fas:`check;sd-text-success` integrated in `SSH-MITM <https://github.com/ssh-mitm/ssh-mitm/blob/master/sshmitm/plugins/scp/inject_file.py>`_


Test with SSH-MITM
------------------

A proof of concept exploit is integrated in ssh-mitm.

This exploit also integrates :doc:`CVE-2019-6111 </vulnerabilities/CVE-2019-6111>` to inject additional files.

To inject files during a file transfer from the server to the client you have to start
ssh-mitm with following arguments:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ ssh-mitm server --scp-interface inject_file --scp-inject /path/to/additional/file

The file transfer for the injected file will be hidden because of the described
vulnerability and :doc:`CVE-2019-6110 </vulnerabilities/CVE-2019-6110>`.
