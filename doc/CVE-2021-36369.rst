CVE-2021-36369
==============

.. card::

    :bdg-warning:`CVSS 8.1` CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H
    ^^^
    The Dropbear client through 2020.81 proceeds with establishing an SSH session even if it has never sent a substantive authentication response.
    This makes it easier for an attacker-controlled SSH server to present a later spoofed authentication prompt
    (that the attacker can use to capture credential data, and use that data for purposes that are undesired by the client user).
