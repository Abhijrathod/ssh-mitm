CVE-2022-29154
==============

.. card::

    :bdg-warning:`CVSS N/A` NVD score not yet provided.
    ^^^
    An issue was discovered in rsync before 3.2.5 that allows malicious remote servers
    to write arbitrary files inside the directories of connecting peers.
    The server chooses which files/directories are sent to the client.
    However, the rsync client performs insufficient validation of file names.
    A malicious rsync server (or Man-in-The-Middle attacker) can overwrite arbitrary files in the
    rsync client target directory and subdirectories (for example, overwrite the .ssh/authorized_keys file).
